Task 3: Add a code of conduct.
A code of conduct helps set ground rules for the behavior of your project's participants. It defines standards for how to engage in a community.

GitHub provides templates for common codes of conduct to help you quickly add one to your project.

To create a new file click on Add file and then Create New File.



Add a new file named CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md to the root folder of the repository. The Choose a code of conduct template button is displayed.



Click the Choose a code of conduct template button. You will see a popup mentioning you may lose unsaved changes. Click on OK.



Click on Contributor Covenant to load this template. Then click Review and submit to add the file to your project.



Scroll down the page to read the content. Click on Commit changes.



Ensure that the radio button to Commit directly to the main/master branch is selected and click Commit changes.
NOTE: In the past the default branch in your GitHub repo used the name master. Effective Oct 1. 2020, all new GitHub repositories use the more inclusive term main as the name of the default branch instead of master.




If the page is zoomed in, you may see only the Commit changes button and not the radio button. Zoom out or scroll down to see the radio button.


Your project now contains a code of conduct.

Contribution guidelines provide clear instructions for individuals looking to contribute to the project. To implement these guidelines, please follow these steps:
